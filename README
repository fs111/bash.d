This is my .bash.d directory. Each file ending in ".sh" will be sourced upon
login via my bashrc file like this:
   
    for i in $HOME/.bash.d/*.sh; do source $i; done
    unset i

This gives me a pretty flexible setup, since I can separate settings for
different tools into different files and in case I do not want them any longer,
I can just rename the file to something not ending in ".sh". Since the .bash.d
directory is under git control, I can even use branches to try out new things
in my environment.


If you want to give it a try, do this:

cd ~
git clone git://github.com/fs111/bash.d.git .bash.d
cd .bash.d
./install
bash
